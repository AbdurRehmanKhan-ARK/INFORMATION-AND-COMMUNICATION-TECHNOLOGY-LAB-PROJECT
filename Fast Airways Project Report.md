## 🎯 Motivation

With web applications playing a central role in modern-day airline booking, our aim was to simulate the user interface of an airline reservation system. This front-end project translates the logic of our C-based backend into a clean, interactive, and modern web design. Though not connected to a backend, it mirrors how real systems engage users visually.

## 🔍 Challenges Faced

- Creating a tab-based booking section that behaves like real systems  
- Ensuring smooth layout alignment across various screen sizes  
- Mimicking interactivity (like login) without actual backend processing  
- Keeping visual consistency across all web pages

---

## 📜 Conclusion

This simulation helped us understand the fundamentals of:

- Structuring scalable front-end systems  
- Implementing client-side interactivity via JavaScript  
- Creating user-friendly interfaces for airline-style workflows  
- Translating backend logic into UI/UX elements

> ✨ “This wasn’t just about building a website | it was a step into the design world, where every pixel had a purpose, and every interaction reflected usability and vision.”

## 🔮 Future Scope

- 🔁 Add backend integration (Node.js, Flask, or PHP)  
- 🧮 Use databases like MySQL or Firebase for real-time bookings  
- 📱 Make the system fully mobile responsive  
- 📧 Add functional email alerts for bookings or password recovery
