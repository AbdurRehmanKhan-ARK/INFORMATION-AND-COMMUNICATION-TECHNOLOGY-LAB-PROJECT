# 🛫 FAST Airways – Front-End Simulation of Airline Reservation System

## 📘 About the Project
**_FAST Airways_** is a front-end airline reservation website created as part of the Information and Communication Technology Lab at FAST NUCES Karachi.
Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project offers a simulated interface of a real airline booking platform. It allows users to navigate through booking tabs, explore destinations, and view static flight pages through a visually structured layout.
The system is designed as a user interface only, with no backend or real data processing. It is not fully responsive, but it effectively demonstrates a professional layout and design flow that mirrors real-world booking systems.

> ⚠️ *Note: This simulation is UI-focused only. No back-end or real-time functionality is implemented.*

## 🎓 Project Background

This project was developed as part of the **Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Lab** coursework at **FAST-NUCES, Karachi**.  
The goal was to visually represent the structure of an airline reservation system, bridging the conceptual logic of our C-based PF Lab backend project into a sleek, modern web interface.

## 🧾 Final Words

* What began as a visual prototype quickly turned into a rewarding exercise in design thinking and front-end architecture.                        
* This website not only mirrors the logic of our PF Lab's backend but also symbolizes our ability to design functional UI models from scratch.   
* By merging creativity with code, this simulation reflects our growing foundation as developers | where clarity, usability, and layout mattered. 
* 💡 *From static structure to responsive interactivity | this was more than a website, it was a learning milestone.*
